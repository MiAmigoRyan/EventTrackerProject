# Technologies used:
* STS4
* MySql Workbench
* github
* restAPI
* postman

#Lessons learned:
* In this initial build I practiced building a DB, mapping entity relationships, and preforming basic crud operations with a Rest API. I also reviewed an practiced deploying a tomcat .war file to an EC2 server.
* Rest API is a powerful and handy api with a number of built in CRUD methods. 
* Postman is a helpful tool for testing connections between various classes and interfaces when they are built sent to the web. 
* MySql Workbench is used to build the database, it allows for a simple an user friendly gui that reduces the ammount of errors that may be encountered writing a DB 'by hand'. 
* gitHub allowed for tracking of changes and a simple way to engage in further collaboration. 
* STS4 is utilized for writing compiling and testing Java code.
